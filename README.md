# OpticalSignalPlotter

This code was used for a project to be displayed at a tech conference.
The resulting paper can be found here: https://www.firecomms.com/contentFiles/components/gdNews/216/IIOT_and_POF_20170508.pdf

This code read a serial value from an MCU. The serial value had information which represented the recieved and sent signal strenght of
an optical signal in real time. This code plots these to signal's using tKinter.
